# Weights and Biases

Weights & Biases helps you keep track of your machine learning projects. Use tools to log hyperparameters and output metrics from your runs, then visualize and compare results and quickly share findings with your colleagues.

[This](https://wandb.ai/gladia/nn-template?workspace=user-lucmos) is an example of a simple dashboard.

## Quickstart

Login to your `wandb` account, running once `wandb login`.
Configure the logging in `conf/logging/*`.

Read more in the [docs](https://docs.wandb.ai/). Particularly useful the [`log` method](https://docs.wandb.ai/library/log), accessible from inside a PyTorch Lightning module with `self.logger.experiment.log`.

> W&B is our logger of choice, but that is a purely subjective decision. Since we are using Lightning, you can replace
`wandb` with the logger you prefer (you can even build your own).
 More about Lightning loggers [here](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extensions/logging.html).
